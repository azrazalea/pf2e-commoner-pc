# 1.1.0

- Added RAW versions of each class. Changed folder structure and class names to make it clear which are which. See README.md for details.
- Cleaned up the class descriptions of each class.
- Moved Commoner class to the root of the compendium so it is more obvious.
- Changed Apprentice Investigator homebrew to both give martial weapon AND on the case, instead of just on the case. This brings it more in balance with other apprentices.
- Added generic Apprentice Spellcaster and Apprentice Martial classes for those who don't want to choose a class to apprentice to.
- Removed Religion from the list for Apprentice Deity Skill as that will never be the skill.
- Removed Nature from the list for Apprentice Druid Skill as that will never be the skill.
- Pared down Witch Patron Skill to only the spellcasting traditions as it will always be one of those.
- Removed Apprentice Monk (Homebrew) extra skill. Powerful Fist and Flurry of Blows is enough. 2 + int modifier will be fine.
