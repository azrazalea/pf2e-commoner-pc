# pf2e-commoner-pc
Contains classes that implement the Pathfinder 2nd edition level 0 Player Character and Apprentice Player Character variant rules (Remaster)

See https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1344 for more details.

## How to use
This is a compendium-only module filled with Class and Class Feature items. For everyday use, you should only need to use the Class items, described below.

## Commoner
The main class for the level 0 rules is Commoner, it is in the root of the Compendium (not in the class folder).

Drag the Commoner class onto your Player Character after manually setting your level to 0 and selecting Ancestry, Heritage, Background, and Ability boosts. It will ask you to choose a proficiency from a small list of simple weapons. After this, you can allocate your 2 + intelligence modifier skills and spend your 5gp on equipment.

## Apprentice Options
I included several apprentice options in the compendium, see descriptions in the different sections below.

To use them, select your Ancestry, Heritage, Background, and Ability Boosts for your character and set your level manually to 0. After this drag the appropriate Apprentice class to the character, any decisions for automated parts of the class will ask you for input.

## Apprentice Martial and Apprentice Spellcaster (Homebrew)
These are generic Apprentice class options for those who don't want or care to choose a specific class to apprentice to. They each get the standard apprentice benefits and one granted skill chosen by the player from a curated subset. These are found in the root of the compendium next to Commoner.

## Apprentices (RAW)
This folder contains Apprentice classes for every class **excluding Kineticist** that are set up as close to RAW as possible. If something doesn't match up, feel free to open an issue.

Kineticist is so different that I did not think a RAW version made sense. You can find my interpretation in Apprentices (Homebrew)

## Apprentices (Homebrew)
This folder contains Apprentice classes for every class, with my interpretation. The intention is to maintain balance between apprentices while still having them have some differentiation by having a small subset of their class's power.

Examples: Investigator gets On the Case feat, Wizard gets Prestidigitation as an extra cantrip, and Witch gets a basic familiar.

### Notes on Homebrew

#### PLEASE read the class and class feature descriptions for the Apprentice (Homebrew) classes. They explain how to do the manual steps involved with setting up the character like choosing skills and spells. A lot of the spellcasters are only different due to their instructions for spell setup, which is completely manual.
