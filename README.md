# pf2e-commoner-pc
Contains classes that implement the Pathfinder 2nd edition level 0 PC and Apprentice PC variant rules (Remaster)

## How to use
This is a compendium-only module. For everyday use, you should only need the Classes folder. The main class for the level 0 rules is Commoner.

Simply drag the Commoner class onto your PC after manually setting your level to 0 and selecting Ancestry, Heritage, Background, and Ability boosts. It will ask you to choose a proficiency from a small list of simple weapons. After this, you can allocate your 2 + intelligence modifier skills and spend your 5gp on equipment. See https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1344 for more details.

### Apprentice Option
Inside the Classes folder is an Apprentice class item for every class existing as of Pathfinder 2e Player Core(2024-02-10).

Select Ancestry, Heritage, Background, and Ability boosts for your character and set your level manually to 0. After this drag the appropriate Apprentice class to the character. Any decisions for automated parts of the class will ask you for input. After that, read the class description to figure out how to finish the manual preparation of the class. If the class does not specify anything about skills in the description, check the details of the class. This will tell you how many additional skills you should manually pick for your character.

#### PLEASE read the class and class feature descriptions for the Apprentice classes. They explain how to do the manual steps involved with setting up the character like choosing skills and spells.

**The apprentice classes diverge from RAW**. The guidance was not comprehensive for making Apprentice classes. A lot of it has to be homebrewed by necessity.

The default rules were boring to me, providing next to no differentiation between the classes. I attempted to make things more interesting while keeping things balanced.

**I could use help with the martial apprentice classes. I do not play martial often and am struggling to create balanced differences between them.**
